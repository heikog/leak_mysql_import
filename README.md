# leak_mysql_import

These are some tools I used to import leaked password files into an mysql database.
Still work in progress and no documentation yet

Its pretty much straigght forward thoug:

If you have a directory of files in the format

    username:password
    
you can use these tools to import them into mysql. Either into one big  table or one table for each file.
